Hey, I’m QnA - I am a Bitcoiner and Freedom Tech enthusiast and I like to help others understand and leverage these tools.

I spend my days building Bitcoin-centric sovereignty tools at [Foundation](https://foundation.xyz) and am the creator of [Bitcoiner.Guide](https://bitcoiner.guide) and [Bitcoiner.Chat](https://bitcoiner.chat).

This site is designed to be your companion through the Nostr universe. It will help you take your first steps to download your first client, and will still be there for you when you're ready to take on the task of running your own relay and zap your friends from your own self-custodial Lightning wallet.

{: .note }
Freedom isn't free. Being truly sovereign online takes time, effort and patience.

The content on this site will not only be my own. I will aim to index and maintain the latest and greatest Nostr educational content to ensure you have the most up-to-date information available to help on your journey. This site is entirely open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA/Hello-Nostr/). Pull requests, issues and suggestions for new or updated content are encouraged and welcomed.

> Together we can decentralize the web. One application at a time.
