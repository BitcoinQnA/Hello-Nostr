![Hello Nostr](/images/hellonostr.png)

I'll do my best to keep this site current and up to date, but Nostr moves pretty fast! Help to ensure the site is as accurate and informative as possible is hugely appreciated! You don't need to be a shadowy super coder to help. Here are some ways in which you can get involved:

- Request a guide or topic that you think others might find useful
Passionate about a certain Bitcoin tool/topic but don't have your own site? I'd be happy to host your writing if it's appropriate
- Translate an article or page into your native language
- Update any info on the site that is no longer accurate
- Fix typos or grammatical errors

Issues and pull requestes are welcomed. I might even zap to say thanks!

**Every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable.**
