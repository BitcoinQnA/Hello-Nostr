This is a Nostr 101, but more technical! Nostr operates without a central server, relying on clients (user applications) and relays (servers) to manage data. Clients are intentionally smart, whilst relays are intentionally 'dumb'. Anyone can build a client and anyone can run a relay. Every user has a public key for identification, and all posts, known as events, are signed to ensure they are authentic.

## Event Structure
At the heart of Nostr are events, which are JSON objects with specific fields:
- **ID**: A unique hash of the event data.
- **Public Key**: Identifies the user who created the event.
- **Timestamp**: When the event was created.
- **Kind**: Defines the event type, like a text note or user metadata.
- **Tags**: Additional context, such as references to other events or users.
- **Content**: The main text or data of the event.
- **Signature**: Verifies the event's authenticity using cryptography.

These events are signed with the user's private key, ensuring that only the owner could have created them, which helps maintain trust in a decentralized system.

## Event Kinds
Relays act like databases, storing events and distributing them to clients based on their requests. Events are categorized by "kinds," which determine how relays handle them. Some examples:
- Kind 0 is for user metadata, like profile information.
- Kind 1 is for short text notes, similar to social media posts.
- Kind 3 is for contacts or 'follow lists'
- Kind 6 is for reposts

There are many more kinds defined by the protocol. A full list can be found on the [Nostr GitHub repository](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips).

## Event Kinds and Relay Behavior
Event kinds categorize events and dictate how relays handle them, providing flexibility for various use cases: Events are further classified by kind ranges, influencing storage and replacement policies:

<div class="table-container">
  <table>
    <tr><th>Kind Range</th><th>Type</th><th>Example Kind</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0-9999</td><td>Regular: Standardized Kinds</td><td>Kind 1 (text note)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10000-19999</td><td>Replaceable Events</td><td>Kind 10,000 (mute list)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>20000-29999  </td><td>Ephemeral Events</td><td>Kind 20200 (temp status update)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>30000-39999</td><td>Parameterized Replaceable Events</td><td>Kind 30001 (Bookmarks or categorized posts)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>40000-49999</td><td>Application specific or custom use</td><td>TBC</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>


## Event Structure
Nostr events are simple JSON objects with a defined structure. The fields include:

<div class="table-container">
  <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>id</td><td>32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA256 hash of the serialized event data</td></tr>
    <tr><td>pubkey</td><td>32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator</td></tr>
    <tr><td>created_at</td><td>Unix timestamp in seconds  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>kind</td><td> Integer between 0 and 65535, specifying event type </td></tr>
    <tr><td>tags</td><td>Array of arrays, each with strings, e.g., ["e", "event_id", "relay_url"]  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>content</td><td>Arbitrary string, the main content of the event </td></tr>
    <tr><td>sig</td><td>64-bytes lowercase hex of the signature, matching the id </td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

The event is serialized using UTF-8 encoding. The `id` is the SHA256 hash of this serialized string, and the `sig` is a Schnorr signature on the 'secp256k1' curve, verifying the event's authenticity. This approach, detailed in [here](https://bips.xyz/340), ensures that only the holder of the corresponding private key could have created the event.

## Event JSON Example

```
{
  "content": "Whats the most exciting thing happening in and around Nostr right now?\n\n#AskNostr",
  "created_at": 1740858071,
  "id": "a4eaed043dc40569dabfcd99f53aad8dd6e9450ed64eb61be005db0ec645b042",
  "kind": 1,
  "pubkey": "a60e79e0edad5100d7543b669e513dbc1c2170e8e9b74fdb8e971afd1e0e6813",
  "sig": "8f9a27944518e93469eddbbce1659fe53ac903d78091a491dc083ce803a6a3cd00c5fcbec2954ea09a6c2617387f05d01eb063b6e96f57e1297aa101dc44e2a5",
  "tags": [["t", "AskNostr"]]
}
```

## Event Tags
Tags enhance event functionality and are what make Nostr more than just a stream of notes. Clients interpret tags to render replies, mentions, or hashtags in the UI. Relays index tags for filtering and querying events (e.g., fetch all events with t:AskNostr).

- **`"e"`:** Refers to another event, e.g., `["e", "event_id", "relay_url"]`, for threading or replies.
- **`"p"`:** Refers to a user, e.g., `["p", "pubkey"]`, for mentions or follows.
- **`"a"`:** Refers to an addressable event, e.g., `["a", "kind:pubkey:d_tag", "relay_url"]`, for specific updates.

  </div>

## Communication Protocol

WebSockets enable real-time communication between clients and relays using JSON-formatted messages: clients publish events like notes or metadata with **`["EVENT", <event>]`**, subscribe to specific event streams (e.g., posts with a hashtag) using **`["REQ", <subscription-id>, <filters>]`**, and receive matching events from relays as **`["EVENT", <subscription-id>, <event>]`**, with relays signaling the end of a data stream via **`["EOSE", <subscription-id>]`**; clients can also terminate subscriptions with **`["CLOSE", <subscription-id>]`**. all encoded in UTF-8 text for seamless, bidirectional updates.

I am by no means a developer, let alone one that specializes in the Nostr protocol. Much of this page is a distillation of my rudimentary understanding, combined with research from other more technical writings about the protocol.
