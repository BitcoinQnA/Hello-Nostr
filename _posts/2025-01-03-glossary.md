All technology has jargon that can seem overwhelming or confusing when starting out. This page should help you quickly understand what everyone is talking about!

# A


###### Alias
Sometimes referred to as 'NIP-05' or 'Nostr ID'. A human-readable name tied to your public key for easier identification on Nostr. It simplifies sharing your profile without using a long key string.

###### Amethyst
The most popular Android only micro-blogging client.

###### Asymmetric Cryptography 
The security method Nostr uses with public and private keys to protect messages. It ensures only you can sign your events, and anyone else's client can easily verify them.


###### Avatar
A profile picture you can add to your Nostr identity via metadata.

<br/>

# B

###### Bitcoin
A decentralized digital currency that Nostr can integrate with for payments like Zaps. It’s not a requirement to use Nostr, but does add a fun aspect to interactions.

###### Broadcast
Sending an event to all connected relays so it spreads across the network. It’s how your post reaches everyone who’s subscribed.

<br/>

# C

###### Censorship Resistance
Nostr’s ability to keep messages flowing even if some relays block them. Anyone can run a relay, so silencing users is much more difficult than on centralized alternatives.


###### Client
Software you use to interact with others on Nostr, like Damus or Primal. It’s your personal gateway to the network.


###### Cryptographic Key Pair
Two linked codes (public and private) that secure your Nostr identity. The public key is shared so other can find you and the private key is your secret.

###### Cross-Posting
Sharing a message to both Nostr and other platforms like Twitter. Some clients let you do this to reach more people.

<br/>

# D

###### Damus
A mobile Nostr app for microblogging, similar to Twitter, created by a developer named 'jb55'.

###### Decentralized
A network setup where no one person or company has full control, like Nostr’s relay system. It gives users freedom over their data.

###### Decentralized Identity
Your Nostr profile, defined by your key pair, not a central database. You own it completely, no company required.

###### Direct Message (DM)
A private note sent between Nostr users, encrypted with their keys. It stays secret unless you share your private key.

###### Discovery
Finding new people or content on Nostr through relays or follows. It’s less automated than big social media but much more organic.

###### DNS (Domain Name System)
A web system sometimes used with Nostr (NIP-05) to link aliases to keys via well-known URIs. It helps make your identity easier to find and looks like an email.

<br/>

# E

###### Encryption
Scrambling messages so only the intended recipient can read them, used in Nostr DMs. It’s like locking a letter with a key only your friend has.

###### Event
A single piece of data on Nostr, like a post, like, or profile update. Everything you do on the network is an event.

###### Event ID
A unique code for each event, created from its content and details. It’s how relays track and share your posts without duplicates.

###### Event Kind
A number that defines what type of event you’re sending, like a note (kind 1) or a follow list (kind 3). It helps clients sort and display data.

###### Event Signature 
A digital stamp made with your private key to prove an event is yours. It’s a security check that anyone can verify with your public key to confirm the authenticity of anything you do on Nostr.

<br/>

# F

###### Fiatjaf
The pseudonmyous creator of Nostr.

###### Filter
A request you send to a relay to get specific events, like posts from one user. It’s how your client customizes what you see on Nostr.

###### Follow List
A list of public keys you subscribe to, stored as an event (kind 3). It’s your personal “following” list on the network.

###### Free Speech
A core idea behind Nostr, letting users post without central control. Relays can filter, but you can always find or run one that doesn’t.

<br/>

# G

###### GitHub
The online platform where most of Nostr’s open-source code is stored and improved. Developers worldwide collaborate there to build the protocol.

###### Gossip Model
A client communication strategy tries to find posts of people that you follow wherever they are most likely to be, based on those people's relay lists as well as half a dozen other heuristics.

###### Graph
A map of who follows whom on Nostr, built from follow lists. It helps suggest new people to connect with.

<br/>

# H

###### Hash
A short, unique code made from data, like an event’s content, for identification. It ensures posts stay unchanged and trackable.

###### HTTP
A web protocol some Nostr tools use alongside WebSockets for extra features. It’s a backup way to connect or share data.

<br/>

# I

###### Immutable
Events on Nostr can’t be changed once signed and sent. It keeps the network honest but means no editing posts.

###### Interoperability
Nostr’s ability to work with other systems, like Bitcoin or Tidal.

###### IoT (Internet of Things)
Smart devices that could use Nostr to communicate without central servers. It’s a future possibility for things like home gadgets.

<br/>

# J

###### JSON
The lightweight format Nostr uses to pack event data, like text or keys, for easy sharing. It’s simple enough for any computer to understand quickly.

<br/>

# K

###### Key Generation
Creating your public and private keys to join Nostr. It’s the first step to getting your identity.

###### Key Management
Keeping your private key safe and backed up so you don’t lose access. It’s your responsibility since there’s no “forgot password” option.

###### Key Pair
The public and private keys that lock and unlock your Nostr account. Your public key is how people can find you, and your private key is how you sign and send all events.

<br/>

# L

###### Lightning Network
A Bitcoin layer that Nostr uses for instant payments, like Zaps. It’s optional but adds a fun tipping culture to the platform.

###### Like
A simple event (kind 7) to show you enjoy someone’s post. It’s a quick way to give a 'thumbs-up' on Nostr.

<br/>

# M

###### Mastodon
Another decentralized social network that Nostr sometimes gets compared to. Nostr is simpler and uses relays instead of Mastodon’s server setup.

###### Metadata
Extra info about you, like your name or bio, stored in a kind 0 event. It’s how you tell others who you are on Nostr.

###### Microblogging
Posting short messages, like tweets, on Nostr clients like Primal. It’s the main way people currently interact on the network.

<br/>

# N

###### NIP (Nostr Implementation Possibility)
A proposal to add features or standards to Nostr, like new event kinds. It’s how the protocol grows with community input.

###### NIP-05
A standard that links your public key to a readable name via a website. It allows others to easily find you with an email-style address.

###### npub
Your public key in a readable format, starting with “npub.” It’s what you share so others can follow or message you.

###### nsec
Your private key in a readable format, starting with “nsec.” Keep it secret as it’s your account’s master key!

###### Nostr
The protocol name. It’s short for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays.”

###### Nostr Wallet Connect
A way for clients to access a remote lightning wallet through a standardized protocol.

<br/>

# O

###### Open Source
Nostr’s code, freely available for anyone to tweak or improve.

<br/>

# P

###### Private Key
Your secret code to sign events and access your Nostr identity. Lose it, and you’re locked out with no recovery. Commonly referred to as your nsec.

###### Primal
A popular cross platform micro blogging client.

###### Profile
Your public info (name, bio, picture) shared via a kind 0 event. It’s how you introduce yourself on Nostr.

###### Public Key
A code you share so others can find or verify your events. It’s your public address on the network. Commonly referred to as your npub.

<br/>

# R

###### Relay
A server that stores and forwards Nostr events to users and other relays. Anyone can run one to help the network and to protect their own data.

###### Repost
Sharing someone else’s event (kind 6) to boost it to your followers. It’s like retweeting on Twitter.

<br/>

# S

###### Satoshis (Sats)
Tiny Bitcoin units used in Nostr Zaps or Assets. They’re like cents for digital tipping.

###### Signature
A cryptographic mark on events proving they’re from you. Your private key makes it; your public key checks it.

###### Social Graph
A web of connections from follow lists showing who’s linked to whom. It’s how Nostr suggests friends or content.

###### Spam
Junk messages that can pop up since Nostr is open. Relays or clients might filter it, but it’s a trade-off for freedom.

<br/>

# T

###### Tag
A label in an event, like “#nostr” or a user mention, to organize or link content.

###### Timestamp
The exact moment an event was created, recorded in each post. It keeps everything in order on your feed.

<br/>

# U

###### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
A web address used in some NIPs, like NIP-05, to tie keys to names. It’s a way to make your ID more readable.

<br/>

# V

###### Value-for-Value
A model where users tip creators with Zaps for good content. It’s a direct “thank you” without ads or middlemen.

###### Verification
Proving an event’s authenticity with its signature and public key. It ensures no one fakes your posts.

<br/>

# W

###### Web Client
A Nostr app that runs in your browser, no download needed. It’s a quick way to try Nostr without installing anything.

###### WebSocket
A fast connection relays use to send events to your client live. It’s like a constant chat line keeping you updated.

###### Well-Known URI
A standard web link (e.g., /.well-known/nostr.json) for NIP-05 identity checks. It connects your key to a name like “you@domain.com.”

<br/>

# Z

###### Zap
A Bitcoin payment sent via Lightning Network to another Nostr user. It’s a fun, instant way to reward great content.
